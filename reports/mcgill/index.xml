&lt;p>In his work of additive synthesis, Shepard introduced an infinitely
ascending chromatic scale.&lt;/p>

An infinitely ascending chromatic scale as presented by Shepard
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This auditory illusion resembles some similarity to the effect caused by
barber-poles in american and british barber shops. In the case of the
barber-poles, one image with colored stripes in diagonal is attached to
a rotating cylinder and presented over and over in circles. The
interesting thing about this process is that the cycle is difficult to
perceive, and therefore, creates the illusion of the stripes ascending
forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, the auditory illusion proposed by Shepard is nothing but an
analogy in the auditory domain, presenting a cycle of raising harmonics
that repeats every octave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to achieve this auditory illusion, we could summarize the steps
proposed by Shepard as following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Computing several harmonics &lt;em>one octave apart&lt;/em> from each other&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The harmonics in the middle must be &lt;em>louder&lt;/em> than the ones at the
beginning or end of the frequency spectrum&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We need to change the gain of each harmonic as time goes on, for
example, using some spectral envelope&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Shepard achieves the change of gain for each harmonic by using a
raised-cosine spectral envelope.&lt;/p>

A time-varying spectral envelope used to create the illusion of the infinitely ascending chromatic scale, as presented by Shepard
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It is mainly this idea of the raised-cosine spectral envelope that has
been preserved and reformulated in the audio effects proposed by
Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker. This type of effects have been called
&lt;em>barber-pole&lt;/em> flanging and phasing illusions, in accordance to the
similarity to the barber-poles, mentioned before in the introduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker present three different ideas for
implementing barber-pole phasing and flanging audio effects: A network
of cascaded time-varying notch filters, a synchronized dual flanger, and
a single-sideband modulation filter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following sections of this paper, I will briefly introduce the
concept of each of these filters proposed by Esqueda, Välimäki, and
Parker. Then, in the following section I am going to provide my
experience implementing one of them, the network of cascaded
time-varying notch filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cascaded-time-varying-notch-filters">Cascaded Time-Varying Notch Filters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the original proposal by Shepard, the methodology considers the
creation of the auditory illusion by means of the additive synthesis of
several harmonics, which are one octave apart, and whose gain is shaped
by the raised-cosine spectral envelope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This and the other audio effects, however, are dealing with a different
problem, which involves not the attempt to &lt;em>synthesize&lt;/em> the illusion
from scratch, but instead, having an input signal and filtering it in
some way so the illusion emerges from the content of the signal itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Phasers and flangers work by creating sweeping &lt;em>notches&lt;/em> in the spectrum
of the original signal, these are the selected mechanisms by Esqueda,
Välimäki, and Parker to create the barber-pole illusions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The magnitude of a network of cascaded notch-filters is presented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each notch in the magnitude response represents the contribution of a
different notch-filter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In general, this method of generating the auditory illusion is the one
that feels the closest to the original proposal by Shepard. For
Shepard, each harmonic represented an additional element in the chain of
additive synthesis. By contrast, in this audio effect each notch-filter
is an additional element in the network that shapes the spectrum of the
original signal so that the barber-pole illusion emerges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The level of gain of each notch-filter, in this case attenuation, is
also controlled by a raised-cosine envelope, and time-varying for every
sample of the signal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="synchronized-dual-flanger">Synchronized Dual Flanger&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The second effect proposed by Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker is a dual
flanger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The design of the system starts as a single flanger. The first
interesting characteristic of this flanger is the decision of using a
sawtooth waves as the Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO) that modulates the
gain of the delayed signal, as well as another sawtooth wave that
modulates the length of the delay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motivation for using a sawtooth LFO is simple and elegant, it
provides an &lt;em>unidirectional&lt;/em> growth over time that abruptly restarts for
the beginning of the next cycle. The auditory illusion requires that the
sweeping of the notches moves in the same direction for the entire
cycle, the sawtooth LFO provides exactly that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One drawback introduced by this approach is the abrupt interruption
introduced by restarting the cycle from one instant to another, which
can give away the cyclic behavior of the system, and which is enemy to
the purpose of creating the auditory illusion. In order to soften the
transition between one cycle and another, the second flanger is added.
Hence, the dual flanger system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second flanger is an identical copy of the first flanger, it also
has a sawtooth LFO modulating the delay range and gain of the flanger,
the main difference is that both LFOs are in a $\frac{pi}{2}$ phase
with respect to their corresponding LFOs in the first flanger.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="single-sideband-modulation">Single-Sideband Modulation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The third method presented by Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker consists of
a system based on the combination of a signal and a frequency-shifted
version of the same signal (single-sideband modulation).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three main important considerations have to be addressed in the method
proposed by Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker. The first consideration is
that the frequency-shifted copy of the signal should be added to the
original signal only after delaying it for a short period. It is the
short delay that generates the notches in the spectrum of the output
signal of the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second consideration is that it is necessary to have linearity
between the frequency shifter and the delay given to the modulated
signal. Once this two considerations are met, the system will produce
notches that are linearly distributed across the spectrum and that sweep
in the same direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the notches produced by the system are linearly distributed, this
does not favor the emergence of the barber-pole illusion. In order for
this to happen, the notches need to be one octave apart from each other,
as in the method by Shepard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third consideration deals with this problem, Esqueda, Välimäki, and
Parker suggest replacing the delay line of the system for a chain of
first-order all-pass filters acting as an spectral delay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this final modification, the system is able to produce sweeping
notches that are one octave from each other provided that the settings
on each of the all-pass filters are accurately optimized to meet the
desired group-delay curve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implementation-of-the-cascaded-time-varying-notch-filters">Implementation of the cascaded time-varying notch-filters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The description of the systems presented by Esqueda, Välimäki, and
Parker is informative regarding the methodologies that should be
followed to accomplish an implementation of each of the systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we follow the methodologies proposed for the first system, the
network of cascaded notch-filters, to implement a prototype of the audio
effect in MATLAB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code of the implementation is given as an accompanying resource to
this paper, the code consists of several functions that compute all of
the parameters required for the system to operate on any given input
signal. The accompanying implementation also provides two main scripts,
one that provides an entry-point for the filter, which should be called
to process an input signal, furthermore, another script tests and makes
use of this entry-point with a white-noise signal and a combination of
parameters that successfully create a barber-pole auditory illusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step in the process of implementing this audio effect is to
separate the global parameters of the system from the time-varying
parameters, i.e., the parameters that should be computed every
short-time (in practice, every sample) in which the filter is operating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This division between global and time-varying parameters is not given by
the original proposal of Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker. Therefore, it
represents an interpretation of the parameters and workflow of the
original methodology that must be made in order to effectively implement
a prototype of the working system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The global parameters of the audio effect are the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$M$: The number of notch-filters in the cascade&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$F_s$: The sampling rate of the system&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$K$: The number of frequencies per cycle. Given by
$K = \text{floor}(F_s/p)$&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$Q$: A control of the bandwidth of the notch-filters&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$p$: The repetition rate of the cycle (how many times is the
system reaching an octave every second), in Hertz&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$L_{min}$: Minimum loudness level, in decibels&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$L_{max}$: Maximum loudness level, in decibels&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The time-varying parameters of the audio effect are the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$f_c(m,k)$: Center frequency of the $m^{th}$ filter in the
$k^{th}$ frequency index of the cycle&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$L_c(m,k)$: Loudness of the $k^{th}$ frequency of the $m^{th}$
filter, in decibels&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$G$: The normalized version of gain $L_c$, in the range
$[0,1]$&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>$\beta$: A factor that involves the bandwidth and the gain at the
bandwidth, used to compute the coefficients of the notch-filters&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Once the most important parameters of the system have been defined and
classified accordingly, the next step is to define the workflow of the
system, especially for the time-varying part of the system which is the
most complicated to implement, as it involves the computation of the
coefficients for all of the filters involved in the network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that the parameter $K$ dictates the number of frequencies that
have to be computed every cycle, this parameter defines the length of
the short-time sections of the signal that have to be processed by the
system. In fact, using the definition provided by Esqueda, Välimäki,
and Parker for computing the value of $K$, we can observe that it is
equivalent to &lt;em>the number of samples that exist in one cycle&lt;/em>. This
means that there is a relationship of one sample for one frequency in
every case, for any sampling rate or repetition rate of the system. At
this point, we can safely assume that our implementation of the audio
effect has to effectively compute a new set of notch-filters for every
sample of the input signal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation that we followed, considers then, that the global
parameters will be provided by the user to the system. One exception are
the global parameters which can be obtained from other global parameters
(e.g., $K$), these are not required from the user and are computed
internally instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the global parameters are present in the system, we then start
processing the signal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The methodology from Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker provides the
transfer function used to compute each of the notch-filters of the
system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$H(z) =
\frac{
\big(
\frac{
1 + g \beta
}{
1 + \beta
}
\big) -
2 \big(
\frac{
\cos(
\frac{
2 \pi f_c
}{
F_s
}
)
}{
1 + \beta
}
\big) z^{-1} +
\big(
\frac{
1 - G \beta
}{
1 + \beta
}
\big) z^{-2}
}{
1 -
2 \big(
\frac{
\cos(
\frac{
2 \pi f_c
}{
F_s
}
)
}{
1 + \beta
}
\big) z^{-1} +
\big(
\frac{
1 - \beta
}{
1 + \beta
}
\big) z^{-2}
}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most efficient way to compute the network of cascaded notch-filters
would be to anticipate the system by multiplying the transfer function
of a network of notch-filters to get one resulting system and use this
system to filter the input signal, however, since the number of
notch-filters in our network is an unknown parameter, $M$, controlled
by the user, it is not easy to come with a strategy to pre-compute all
the possible numbers of notch-filters in the network and their
combinations with different parameters, such as the rate of the cycle of
the audio effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, I have decided that it is probably an easier strategy to use
this transfer function to go back to the difference equation of the
system, and compute the pertinent values of the coefficients of the
system &lt;em>as they are needed&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difference equation of a notch-filter is the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$y[n] = b_0 x[n] - b_1 x[n-1] + b_2 x[n-2] + a_1 y[n-1] - a_2 y[n-2]$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where the coefficients of the system correspond to&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$b_0 = \frac{
1 + G \beta
}{
1 + \beta
}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$b_1 =
\frac{
2
\cos(
\frac{
2 \pi f_c
}{
F_s
})
}{
1 + \beta
}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$b_2 = \frac{
1 - G \beta
}{
1 + \beta
}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$a_1 = b_1$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$a_2 = \frac{
1 - \beta
}{
1 + \beta
}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final implementation consists then of a delay-line of second order
which filters the input signal through a cascade of $M$ notch-filters.
The coefficients of the notch-filters are computed for every sample,
according to the properties of each notch-filter, namely, their center
frequency $f_c$ and the attenuation computed for that center frequency
$(L_c, G)$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation was done in Matlab, and all the source code is
available &lt;a href="/media/mumt501/barberpole.zip">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an example, here is an audio input to the system and what it comes out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input [&lt;a href="/media/mumt501/input.wav">wav&lt;/a>]&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this paper, I outline the implementation of a cascaded notch-filter
system to create auditory illusions from an input signal. The reference
methodology by Esqueda, Välimäki, and Parker was very informative
about the parameters, formulas and methodologies used to test the filter
and generate the sound samples and the plots presented in their paper.
The implementation proposed here used the transfer function presented in
the reference methodology and used it to get the difference equation of
a notch-filter, computing its parameters for every sample and using
those coefficients to filter the input signal through a delay-line of
second order.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUMT 615: Melodic Tension Experiment</title><link>/reports/mcgill/mumt615/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/reports/mcgill/mumt615/</guid><description>&lt;p>An experiment on melodic tension, implemented with jsPsych.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the course &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/mumt-616" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MUMT 616: Timbre as a Form-Bearing Dimension in Music&lt;/a>, I talked about inharmonicity in the context of plucked strings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The slides are available &lt;a href="/media/mumt616/inharmonicity_presentation.pdf">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Five examples with varying degrees of inharmonicity are discussed. The examples are qualitatively classified as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#no-inharmonicity">No inharmonicity&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#low-inharmonicity">Low inharmonicity&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#mid-inharmonicity">Mid inharmonicity&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#high-inharmonicity">High inharmonicity&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#extreme-inharmonicity">Extreme inharmonicity&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The musical examples were generated from &lt;a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/4_Pieces_for_Guitar_%28Ponce%2C_Manuel%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manuel María Ponce&amp;rsquo;s Valse for Solo Guitar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inharmonicity was computed for each partial using the following formula:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ f_n = nf_0 \sqrt{1 + Bn^2} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where $f_n$ is the frequency of a given partial, and the $B$ parameter controls the inharmonicity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://supercollider.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuperCollider programming language&lt;/a> was used to generate the audio examples with varying inharmonicity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code is &lt;a href="#supercollider-code-for-generating-the-audio-samples">listed here&lt;/a> for reference.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="examples">Examples&lt;/h2>

(2007).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a report for my final project of the &lt;a href="https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/618/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MUMT 618: Computational Modeling of Musical Acoustic Systems&lt;/a> class at McGill University.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will describe my experience implementing a digital model of distortion that has been presented in the paper titled &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Simplified, physically-informed models of distortion and overdrive guitar effects pedals&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, presented in 2007 by David Yeh, Jonathan Abel, and Julius Smith at the DAFx'07 Conference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although this paper describes two models:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Boss DS-1&lt;/strong>, a distortion pedal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ibanez TS-9&lt;/strong>, an overdrive pedal&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I have only implemented the model of the &lt;strong>Boss DS-1&lt;/strong> distortion pedal. The implementation provided has been done in &lt;code>MATLAB&lt;/code> and does not opertate in real-time, however, a real-time implementation should not be difficult to derivate from the given code. I also provide a few audio examples of the audio effect. As of my knowledge, there are no existing audio examples or code for this model previous to this write-up, therefore, I consider it is a valuable contribution for anyone following the ideas of this paper for reproducing or improving the model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A high-level overview can be seen in the following diagram from the paper&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is possible that all of these stages may have an audible effect in the output produced by the physical pedal, however, the model only provides a continuous-time transfer function for the &lt;code>Gain + filter&lt;/code> and the &lt;code>Saturating nonlin&lt;/code> stages, therefore, this implementation concentrates in these two stages only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The diagrams presented in the paper are excerpts of the circuit, which are sometimes difficult to follow, therefore, as an additional resource, it was very helpful to consult this article from &lt;a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/boss-ds1-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElectroSmash&lt;/a>. In this document, a full view of the schematic is displayed with the different stages labeled.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;code>Gain + filter&lt;/code> stage in the paper&amp;rsquo;s diagram corresponds to the &lt;code>Transistor Booster&lt;/code> stage of the schematic, its main component is a bipolar junction transistor. The &lt;code>Saturating nonlin&lt;/code> stage of the paper&amp;rsquo;s diagram corresponds roughly to the &lt;code>Op-Amp Gain Stage&lt;/code>.

H(s) = \frac{s^{2}}{(s + \omega_1) (s + \omega_2)}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where $ \omega_1 = 2\pi3 $ and $ \omega_2 = 2\pi600 $&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="op-amp-gain-stage">Op-Amp Gain Stage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This stage corresponds to the main nonlinearity of the circuit, according to the paper. One parameter is provided in this stage to control the amount of distortion that the audio effect will output. The continuous-time transfer function is defined as following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
H(s) = \frac{(s + \frac{1}{R_t C_c}) (s + \frac{1}{R_b C_z}) + \frac{s}{R_b C_c}}{(s + \frac{1}{R_t C_c})(s + \frac{1}{R_b C_z})}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where
$$R_t = 100 000 D $$
$$R_b = (1-D)100 000 + 4700$$
$$C_z = 0.000 001$$
$$C_c = 0.000 000 000 250$$
and $D$ is the &lt;strong>distortion&lt;/strong> knob that controls the depth of the effect and ranges from $[0, 1]$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one may guess, these continuous-time transfer functions require discretization in order to be implemented in a digital system. In order to discretize them, Yeh et al. propose the use of the &lt;em>bilinear transform&lt;/em>. In the paper&amp;mdash;as well as in David Yeh&amp;rsquo;s PhD dissertation&amp;mdash;a list of (very useful) templates has been included, which helps in the process of discretizing the two continuous-time transfer functions used in this model. The relevant templates for this implementation are the templates corresponding to second-order filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bilinear-transform">Bilinear Transform&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to discretize a continuous-time transfer function, first, we should put the continuous-time transfer function in the following form
$$
H(s) = \frac{b_2 s^2 + b_1 s + b_0}{a_2 s^2 + a_1 s + a_0}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we compute the corresponding coefficients, they can be placed in a discrete-time transfer function of the form&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
H(z) = \frac{B_0 + B_1 z^{-1} + B_2 z^{-2}}{A_0 + A_1 z^{-1} + A_2 z^{-2}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The discrete-time coefficients of this transfer function can be obtained from the following equations
$$
B_0 = b_0 + b_1 c = b_2 c^2
$$
$$
B_1 = 2b_0 - 2b_2 c^2
$$
$$
B_2 = b_0 - b_1 c = b_2 c^2
$$
$$
A_0 = a_0 + a_1 c = a_2 c^2
$$
$$
A_1 = 2a_0 - 2a_2 c^2
$$
$$
A_2 = a_0 - a_1 c = a_2 c^2
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After plugging the coefficients into the discrete-time transfer function, we should be able to implement the resulting transfer function as a digital filter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implementation-of-the-transistor-booster-stage">Implementation of the Transistor Booster Stage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Using the steps described above, I now describe the implementation of the &lt;code>Transistor Booster Stage&lt;/code> part of the model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step would be to put the given continuous-time transfer function in the form of the bilinear transform template
$$
H(s) = \frac{s^2}{s^2 + (\omega_1 + \omega_2)s + \omega_1 \omega_2}
$$
From here, the continuous-time coefficients can be easily extracted
$$
b_2 = 1
$$
$$
b_1 = 0
$$
$$
b_0 = 0
$$
$$
a_2 = 1
$$
$$
a_1 = \omega_1 + \omega_2 = 2\pi 3 + 2\pi 600 = 1206\pi
$$
$$
a_0 = \omega_1 \omega_2 = (2\pi 3)(2 \pi 600) = 7200\pi^2
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working the templates for the discrete-time coefficients results in the following
$$
B_0 = 4fs^2
$$
$$
B_1 = -8fs^2
$$
$$
B_2 = 4fs^2
$$
$$
A_0 = 7200\pi^2 + 2412\pi fs + 4fs^2
$$
$$
A_1 = 14400\pi^2 - 8fs^2
$$
$$
A_2 = 7200\pi^2 - 2412\pi fs + 4fs^2
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Showing once again the template of the second-order discrete-time transfer function
$$
H(z) = \frac{B_0 + B_1 z^{-1} + B_2 z^{-2}}{A_0 + A_1 z^{-1} + A_2 z^{-2}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plugging the values of the coefficients recently found, gives the following equation
$$
{\scriptsize H(z) = \frac{4fs^2 - 8fs^2 z^{-1} + 4fs^2 z^{-2}}{(7200\pi^2 + 2412\pi fs + 4fs^2) +(14400\pi^2 - 8fs^2) z^{-1} + (7200\pi^2 - 2412\pi fs + 4fs^2) z^{-2}}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After dividing by $4$, factorizing $fs$, and doing some algebra to simplify the equation, this can be expressed as:
$$
{\small H(z) = \frac{1 -2 z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{(1800 \Omega^2 + 603 \Omega + 1) + (3600 \Omega^2 - 2) z^{-1} + (1800\Omega^2 - 603\Omega + 1) z^{-2}} }
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>with $\Omega = \frac{\pi}{fs}$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation of this discrete-time transfer function results in a filter with the following magnitude response:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Luckily, in the corresponding section of this stage, the paper mentions that the expected gain in the bandpass is, in fact, $36dB$. Using this information, an additional gain, $g$, is included in the discrete-time transfer function:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
{\small H(z) = \frac{g(1 -2 z^{-1} + z^{-2})}{(1800 \Omega^2 + 603 \Omega + 1) + (3600 \Omega^2 - 2) z^{-1} + (1800\Omega^2 - 603\Omega + 1) z^{-2}} }
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where the equation, $36dB = \log_{10}(g) * 20$, can be used to obtain the value of $g$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
g = 10^{\frac{36}{20}} = 63.0957

&lt;h2 id="implementation-of-the-op-amp-gain-stage">Implementation of the Op-Amp Gain Stage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just as done during the &lt;code>Transistor Booster Stage&lt;/code>, the implementation of the &lt;code>Op-Amp Gain Stage&lt;/code> starts from a given continuous-time transfer function
$$
H(s) = \frac{(s + \frac{1}{R_t C_c}) (s + \frac{1}{R_b C_z}) + \frac{s}{R_b C_c}}{(s + \frac{1}{R_t C_c})(s + \frac{1}{R_b C_z})}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Putting this transfer function in the form of the bilinear transform template
$$
H(s) = \frac{s^2 + (\frac{1}{R_b C_z} + \frac{1}{R_t C_c} + \frac{1}{R_b C_c})s + \frac{1}{R_t C_c R_b C_z}}{s^2 + (\frac{1}{R_b C_z} + \frac{1}{R_t C_c})s + \frac{1}{R_t C_c R_b C_z}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The continous-time coefficients can be obtained
$$
b_2 = 1
$$
$$
b_1 = \frac{1}{R_b C_z} + \frac{1}{R_t C_c} + \frac{1}{R_b C_c}
$$
$$
b_0 = \frac{1}{R_t C_c R_b C_z}
$$
$$
a_2 = 1
$$
$$
a_1 = \frac{1}{R_b C_z} + \frac{1}{R_t C_c}
$$
$$
a_0 = \frac{1}{R_t C_c R_b C_z}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of these coefficients are equivalent (e.g., $a_0 = b_0$), therefore, they can be summarized in the following coefficients:
$$
ab_2 = 1
$$
$$
a_1 = \frac{1}{R_b C_z} + \frac{1}{R_t C_c}
$$
$$
b_1 = a_1 + \frac{1}{R_b C_c}
$$
$$
ab_0 = \frac{1}{R_t C_c R_b C_z}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step is to obtain the discrete-time coefficients, these can be expressed in terms of the simplified list of continuous-time coefficients presented above:
$$
B_0 = ab_0 + b_1 c + c^2
$$
$$
B_1 = 2ab_0 - 2c^2
$$
$$
B_2 = ab_0 - b_1 c + c^2
$$
$$
A_0 = ab_0 + a_1 c + c^2
$$
$$
A_1 = 2ab_0 - 2c^2
$$
$$
A_2 = ab_0 - a_1 c + c^2
$$&lt;/p>

&lt;p>During the course &lt;a href="https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt621_18/mumt621.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MUMT 621: Music Information Acquisition, Preservation, and Retrieval&lt;/a>, I designed and implemented a model for symbolic key detection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The model was later extended to work with &lt;strong>audio&lt;/strong> data and to retrieve &lt;strong>local-key&lt;/strong> estimations as well. A &lt;a href="/publication/keydetection19">dedicated entry in this website&lt;/a> exists for the extended version, which was published in the proceedings of DLfM 2019.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finding the key of a piece of Western art music has been in the interest
of the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community for several years
already. Since they were introduced, the design or acquisition of
key-profiles have been the preferred methodology to solve this problem.
In this project, we combine the use of key-profiles with the
capabilities of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to model the time-varying
aspects of music to find the key of a piece of music by considering the
pitch-class of every note in the piece as the observation symbol of an
HMM.&lt;/p>

as a hidden state in the model. All of the keys may transition to any of
the other 23 keys, however, the probability of transitioning to neighbor
keys in the circle of fifths is preferred over distant keys.&lt;/p>

for the task of key detection, the emission of &lt;em>diatonic&lt;/em> tones of the
key are preferred over accidental tones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The initial probabilities of the model are the same for each key, $p(state) = \frac{1}{24}$.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The probability distributions for state transitions that happen after
the initialization have been taken from a geometric model of key

group of neighbors decreases exponentially. The geometric model of key
distance can be observed in&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using this model, we can observe, for example, a list of the groups of
neighbor keys for C Major, in descending order:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Group Keys
0 C
1 G F a c
2 d e f g
3 D Eb A Bb

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This structure of nine groups of neighbours repeats for all major and
minor keys. We can use these groups to compute the transition
probability for any key according to the following formula:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$p(s) = \alpha^{(G-1) - s_g}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where $G$ is the number of groups of neighbor keys to the current
tonic, according to the geometric model (i.e., $G=9$), $s_g$ is the
group to which the key $s$ belongs, $\alpha$ is the probability
ratio between a key of one group and a key from a contiguous group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The model has been evaluated using sets of short musical compositions in
all major and minor keys. Each set follows the format of the

Well-Tempered Clavier, Volume I, by Johann Sebastian Bach (24 MIDI
files); The Well-Tempered Clavier (Part II), by Johann Sebastian Bach
(24 MIDI files); Preludes Op.28, by Frédéric Chopin (24 midi files); 4
of the 24 preludes from Op.11, by Alexander Scriabin (4 MIDI files);
Preludes and Fugues Op.87, by Dmitri Shostakovich (48 MIDI files). In
total, 124 MIDI files were used for testing the algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if these MIDI files have not been explicitly annotated with their
keys and modulations, the main key of each of the selected pieces has
been clearly established by the composer in the original scores, meaning
an evaluation process of the algorithm is possible at least against the
main key of the musical piece.&lt;/p>

correctly 103 out of 124 keys in the MIDI files from the dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The worst performance of the algorithm used a ratio of $\alpha = 2$,
the key-profiles from Krumhansl and Kessler for major keys, and the
key-profiles from Aarden and Essen for the minor keys. With this
configuration, the algorithm guessed 49 out of 124 keys in the MIDI
files from the dataset.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUTH 251: Essay on Brahms Intermezzo Op.118 No.2</title><link>/reports/mcgill/muth251/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/reports/mcgill/muth251/</guid><description>&lt;p>A short music-theoretical essay on Brahms Intermezzo Op.118 No.2&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the course &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/muth-251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MUTH 251: Theory and Analysis 4&lt;/a>, I wrote a short essay on Brahms Intermezzo Op.118 No.2.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Intermezzo Op.118 No.2 in A Major is one of the six piano pieces
published in the&amp;mdash;late work&amp;mdash;Op.118. The piece has a large ternary
form, characteristic of slow movements, with a main theme that extends
from the anacrusis before the first measure to measure 49, an interior
theme in F# minor that extends from measure 49 to measure 73, and
finally (after a brief retransition), a return of the main theme that
concludes the piece from measures 76 to 116. The structure of the three
larger sections consist, in all cases, of small ternary forms described
throughout this essay.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="main-theme-exposition">Main Theme: Exposition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The piece starts with a simple and interesting motive in the upper
voice, arguably the most important sonority of the intermezzo: A
descending second from C# to B as an anacrusis of eighth notes,
followed by an ascending third that culminates in a D half note at the
beginning of measure 1. The pattern is repeated in the third beat of
measure 1, this time replacing the ascending third with
an&amp;mdash;unusual&amp;mdash;ascending seventh going to an A one line above the treble
staff, at the beginning of measure 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These first two measures already introduced a lot of the material that
will be used throughout the piece, namely, the descending seconds, the
metric structure (which for now, remains accentuated on the first beat
of the measure, as it is notated, but will change constantly throughout
the piece), and the ascending seventh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the important motivic material from the beginning of the piece to
the first two beats of measure 2, which I denominated &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em>,
follows another motive, which will be particularly important in its
rhythmic structure rather than its intervallic configuration, a dotted
eight followed by a sixteenth note. In the context of its first
appearance, this motive, which I denominated &lt;em>Motive X&lt;/em>, is presented in
two instances, first, in a pre-dominant harmony at the third beat of
measure 2 and then a dominant seventh harmony at the beginning of
measure 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the piece continues, it will feel as if this &lt;em>Motive X&lt;/em> has been
introduced by Brahms with the purpose of changing the pulse of the music
at pleasure. Particularly, when it is presented with an augmentation of
the rhythmic figure. Two pairs of descending seconds at measures 3 and 4
complement &lt;em>Motive X&lt;/em> before &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> is reintroduced at the end of
measure 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="main-theme-contrasting-middle">Main Theme: Contrasting Middle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The harmonic material of the measures comprehending the beginning of the
piece (i.e., 1-16) comply with the Exposition section of a small ternary
form, ending with a PAC in the dominant (E Major) at measure 16.
Following the closing PAC of the Exposition, starts the Contrasting
Middle section of the Main Theme, at the third beat of measure 16. At
this point, the notated meter and the experienced meter are in conflict
as the third beat of measure 16 becomes the accentuated beat. In order
to introduce the new meter, Brahms has made use of a more dense texture
in the previous measure, particularly, a salient melodic movement of a
tritone within two eighth notes in the third beat of measure 15, which
intensifies the role of the third beat that is ultimately necessary for
transitioning to the contrasting middle section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contrasting middle comes with its own set of motivic materials on
the upper voice, which will be recurrent through the rest of the piece:
a figure of a “pedal” dominant (and later tonic) at the third beat,
followed by a descending second at the beginning of the measure,
appearing for the first time on measure 17 with the notes E, F#, E. The
motive, which I called “Motive B”, then adds a leap of a fifth between
the pedal note and the descending seconds in measure 18, turning into E,
B, A.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At measure 20 (i.e., third beat of measure 19 and first two beats of
measure 20), the pedal at the beginning of the motive has moved to the
tonic. First, replicating the intervallic relationships at the beginning
of the contrasting middle with A, B, A (i.e., a pedal, an ascending
second, and a descending second). However, the ascending second between
the pedal and the second note of the motive is replaced by an ascending
third in measure 22 (A, C, A), a configuration that did not appear in
the pedal dominant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time we arrive to measure 23 and 24, the almost infallible bass
on the third beat of each measure of the contrasting middle has been
removed, and with it, the experienced meter has again been compromised.
Brahms clearly establishes the experienced meter at the beginning of
measure 25, in accordance with the notated meter. This measure also
signals the beginning of a sequential passage (measures 25-28, plus the
resolution on the subdominant of measure 29) that concludes the
contrasting middle of the Main Theme and moves into the Recapitulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="main-theme-recapitulation">Main Theme: Recapitulation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Brahms “sneaks” an off-beat descending second at the second half of
measure 29, that, together with the leap of a seventh above at measure
30, confirms the return of &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em>, or at least of its second half.
What follows next seems to be a combination of the descending seconds
accompanying &lt;em>Motive X&lt;/em> at the Exposition of the Main Theme and the
descending eighth notes that initiate &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em>. This hybrid motive
makes up for the first quarter of the Recapitulation (measures 30-34).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very interesting inversion of &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> follows next, at the third
beat of measure 35. The rhythmic values of &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> are respected and
the general intervals inverted: an ascending second in eighth notes
followed by a descending third (third beat of measure 34 to first beat
of measure 35), and then, the same ascending second followed by a
descending seventh (end of measure 35 to measure 36). &lt;em>Motive X&lt;/em> also
comes back in two instances, this time accompanied by a denser
succession of eighth notes (measure 37).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brahms, yet another time, overrides the experienced meter at the end of
measure 38 and brings, unexpectedly, the motive of the contrasting
middle (i.e., &lt;em>Motive B&lt;/em>) to the Recapitulation. The version of &lt;em>Motive
B&lt;/em> has the tonic as the pedal, however, it preserves the same intervals
presented originally at the dominant pedal during the Contrasting
Middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During measure 41, something remarkable happens, a variation of the
rhythmic &lt;em>Motive X&lt;/em> is presented (augmentation with a dotted quarter and
an eighth note), which helps to override the experienced meter at the
beginning of measure 42, in accordance to the notated meter. Brahms
quickly departs from the new meter once more, at the end of measure 42,
establishing again the third beat as the accentuated beat. The same play
on the experienced meter repeats at measure 46, however, even though the
rhythmic circumstances are analogous, this time, the meter cannot be
reinterpreted at the third beat due to a surprising factor, Brahms has
brought &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> to the voice of the contralto. &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> is
anacrusic and we have listened to it several times, it becomes evident
whenever it returns, and now it has come back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The experienced meter is preserved as strong on the first beat of
measure 47, and as we might expect from feeling those two eighth notes
as an anacrusis to the rest of &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em>, it continues into measure 48.
This last measure also signals the end of the Recapitulation and the
Main Theme of the Intermezzo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of the Main Theme, Brahms has taught us two important
lessons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The absolute importance of &lt;em>Motive A.&lt;/em> &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em>, which had been
used mostly in the context of a sub-dominant harmony, is now
concluding the PAC of the Main Theme. That big leap of a seventh
could actually be the closing Tonic of the piece (and when we reach
the end of the piece, we confirm that this is the case).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Experienced meter is crucial in this piece. &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> is anacrusic,
containing two eighth notes on the third beat before the accentuated
half note. &lt;em>Motive B&lt;/em>, on the other hand, is not anacrusic and, when
introduced, is usually started on the third beat of the measure.
This dual role of the third beat of being an anacrusis or the
strongest beat is going to be (frequently) exploited by Brahms to
move seamlessly through different experienced meters. Additionally,
a dual role of the second beat is also going to be introduced in the
Interior Theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="interior-theme-exposition">Interior Theme: Exposition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If I had to extend on what Brahms meant with the &lt;em>in tempo&lt;/em> marking at
the beginning of the exposition of the interior theme (measure 49), I
would write: “Here, in measures 49-56, expression is achieved through
accentuation and not through tempo rubato”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brahms has already presented us the resources needed to move the
experienced meter of the music during the Main Theme. Now, it is time to
put it in practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Interior Theme follows the convention of modal mixture, it starts
with F# minor. The experienced meter is in congruence with the notated
meter. The motivic material does not resemble neither &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> nor
&lt;em>Motive B.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right from the beginning, we are exposed to accompanying triplets in the
bass and a melodic line in the upper voice. Until measure 51, the upper
voice suggests the continuation of the metric stress on the first beat
of each measure, then, a change in the rhythmic pattern at measure 52
strengthens the second beat and its descending figure of step and
thirds. This metric stress of the second beat is confirmed on measure
53, however, it is quickly corrected on measure 54 and until the end of
the Exposition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="interior-theme-contrasting-middle">Interior Theme: Contrasting Middle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The contrasting middle of the Interior Theme starts right after the
repetition bar, at measure 57. The texture of this section is mostly
homorhythmic-homophonic, in a choral style. The key features a modal
mixture of F# Major, contrasting with the F# minor of the Exposition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More importantly, the experienced meter of this section changes abruptly
to a 2/4 meter, accentuating the second beat of measure 57 and
continuing with an experienced 2/4 meter until the cadential six-four
chord at measure 64. The contrasting middle concludes with a C#
dominant seventh chord that brings back the theme of the Exposition,
this time in the Recapitulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="interior-theme-recapitulation">Interior Theme: Recapitulation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In measure 65, Motive C of the interior theme comes back. This time, the
melodic line is not presented in the upper voice but alternating between
the register of the tenor and the contralto. One substantial difference
to the Exposition is that the play of modifying the experienced meter is
absent. Brahms begins the rhythmic pattern to stress the second beat of
measure 68 but abruptly replaces the culmination of that pattern with a
quarter note rest at the beginning of measure 69.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The texture of the Recapitulation feels more based on counterpoint than
the Exposition did. The experienced meter is kept in accordance to the
notated meter and the PAC finally comes at measure 73, closing with the
F# minor tonic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="return-of-the-main-theme">Return of the Main Theme&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After the resolution of the PAC of the interior theme, a small
retransition that continues with the triplet figures, extending from
measures 73 to 76, helps to connect the Interior Theme with the return
of the Main Theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the Exposition, the texture of the upper voice is denser,
particularly where the &lt;em>Motive X&lt;/em> is reintroduced. The Contrasting
Middle returns in the third beat of measure 84. Just as it did during
the Main Theme at the beginning, the Recapitulation is left intact,
combining motivic material from &lt;em>Motive A&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Motive B&lt;/em>. The leap of
the seventh, so salient at the beginning of the piece, now blends into
the arpeggiated tonic triad, during the PAC that closes this beautiful
Intermezzo.&lt;/p>
