I am passionate about the use of modern technologies to
learn, understand, create, and enjoy music.

I wrote my PhD dissertation on deep learning models for
automatic Roman numeral analysis. 

Nowadays, I work as a developer (and AI Researcher) for the
Sibelius music notation software, within Avid Technology.
