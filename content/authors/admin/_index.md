I am passionate about the use of modern technologies to
learn, understand, create, and enjoy music.

Within that broad goal, I specialize in symbolic music processing, computational music theory, audio signal processing, and deep learning.
For example, I wrote my PhD dissertation on [deep learning models for
automatic Roman numeral analysis](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r6307).
