## Abstract

During the course [MUMT 620: Gestural Control of Sound Synthesis](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/mumt-620), I developed a musical game mechanic, where players compete to complete a "cadence".

The backend gestural interface of the game is implemented in [PureData](https://puredata.info/) and the graphic interface in [MobMuPlat](http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/).

The paper of the project is available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2554665#.X5LY9JpE160).

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/napulen/tictacchord).
