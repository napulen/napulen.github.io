## Abstract

During the course [MUMT 615: Perception of Compositional Structures](https://perceptionofcompositionalstructures.github.io/), we designed an experiment on melodic tension.

I participated developing the code of the experiment. [Erica Huynh](https://www.mcgill.ca/music/erica-huynh) designed the experiment and wrote the paper, and [Timothy Ledger](https://www.timothymledger.com/) composed the musical examples.

The experiment was implemented using the [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) library.

The live experiment website is available [here](https://melodictension-7fd48.firebaseapp.com/).

The source code of the experiment is available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/napulen/melodictension).

The paper with our results is available [here](https://perceptionofcompositionalstructures.github.io/Docs/Group2_TensionInMelody_FinalProject_HuynhLedgerNapoles.pdf).
